# LU-decomposition
Given a system of linear eqiations of size n x n 
a simple solving with LU decomposition method:
1- LU = A
2- AX = LU(X) = L(UX) = b
3- Ly = b
4- UX = y
then a simple implemention of a linear equations system solving 
with regular positioning for step 3
and reverse positioning for step 4
